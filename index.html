      <h1> about me </h1>
      <p>
        i moved to nyc to pursue my dream of acting. in between rehearsals and auditions, i started taking online programming classes and teaching myself how to code as a hobby.
        <br/></br/>
        slowly but surely, coding became the most fun i was having day to day, so i decided to join the flatiron school to become a full stack web developer.
        <br /> <br/>
        in programming iâ€™ve found all my favourite things: creativity, problem solving and a tool for social impact.
        <br/> <br/>
        occassionally i get to sneak in some of my 8-bit art into my projects.

      <h1> why buzzfeed? </h1>

      <p>
        as a latina in tech, diversity is really important to me. buzzfeed is a brand that has always made me feel included, supported and celebrated, which media has not always made me feel.
        <span class="orange"> i would love to work at a company where i can make that change for other people that have felt like me. </span>
        <br /> <br />
        i think tech can be used as a tool for social change because it's the most effective way to reach people in their daily life. i want to work to create really <span class="orange">high-impact products that make a difference</span> be it make someone laugh or challenge someone's world view.
        <br /><br />
        i love buzzfeed. it's how i choose to unwind after a long day of work. as a consumer, <span class="orange"> i'd love to work at a place whose product i already love</span>, and make it better for other people who love it too!

        <span> <img src="img/arrow.jpeg" width="30px"/> i taught myself intro to c, ruby, and html/css for fun. i also keep a <a href="http://pattyscoding.tumblr.com" target="_blank"> blog </a> about my coding discoveries.
          <br /><span class="orange">i really love learning.</span>
        </span>
        <br/></br/>
        <span> <img src="img/arrow.jpeg" width="30px"/> i just finished a very intensive web dev program including (but not limited to!) ruby on rails, sinatra, react/redux, sql and git.
         <span class="orange">i can pick up learn languages and frameworks fast.  </span>
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <span> <img src="img/arrow.jpeg" width="30px"/> i'm a team player, and also very self-motivated. i'm very excited about finally joining the tech community after watching from the sidelines.
         <span class="orange">i know my excitement and passion will make me a key team member!</span>
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        <span> <img src="img/arrow.jpeg" width="30px"/> i've worked on 3 full sized projects on 3 different frameworks: <br />
          <span class="project"><b><a href="http://toomanycakes.herokuapp.com" target="_blank"> too many cakes </a></b></span> is an app very dear to my heart since it aims to reduce food waste by sharing leftovers with friends (ruby on rails and sql)<br/>
